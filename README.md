# Automate 

Set up a developer Arch Linux laptop in 30 minutes or less without any manual input. This repo uses ansible to set up my custom Arch Linux environment. You can easily tweak it for your distro with some research. 


## Things that I haven't automated yet

- Lunarvim installation: It has too many prompts.

- gnupg pass init and mw setup: This can't be automated. 

- hugo: This is done with the make command in my website repo.
